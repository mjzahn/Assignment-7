### Package title
{ggplot2}

### Location
You can install this package on both [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) and [Github](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)

### Vignette(s)
ggplot2 has several vignettes in addition to standard help files. It has three topics covered: 1) aesthetic specifications, 2) extending ggplot2, and 3) using ggplot2 in packages. The first topic is probably the most commonly referred to vignette as it covers the primary calls/arguments when using ggplot2 to plot.

### Application(s)
Yes, there is a website like the one we built, which can be found [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). This website includes a variety of resources including a cheat sheet which can be pulled from github [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization.pdf).

### Review
The primary purpose of the ggplot2 package is for graphics and visualizing data. This package improves on plotting in base R in that you can easily call aesthetic arguments (e.g., black and white) to create clean, easy-to-read figures. One of the most common uses I have with ggplot2 is its faceting capabilities. With one easy line, `facet_wrap()`, I can break up data into groups and visualize each group side-by-side in subplots. Generally, this package was pretty easy to learn in its basic form. However, learning to customize my figures using ggplot2 took more patience and skill. For example, custom colors can be tricky depending on what you want. I have also found that a ggplot2 call for a single plot can very quickly become dozens of lines of code which becomes a bit cumbersome to edit/review, especiall if annotated with comments. In any case, I think there is a lot of utility in this package, and I have and will continue to recommend this package to other R users.
